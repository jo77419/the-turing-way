# How accessibility intersects with Data Science

## What is accessibility?

Accessibility is defined to mean that someone isn’t excluded from something because of a disability, impairment or neurological difference. These impairments should not mean that anyone is disadvantaged when using technology. Good design considers the implications of these impairments or differences by implementing appropriate solutions. 

## Why should I care?

Web applications need to meet accessibility standards so that people aren’t excluded from using them by default – although the same requirement isn’t mandated for all types of Data Science product, it’s still the right thing to consider and address potential accessibility issues. Applications and products that are accessible are also beneficial for people who don’t have accessibility needs, thus resulting in a more useful end-product.

## How is this relevant to data science?

Data Science products are often visual and include lots of data. Both can present accessibility challenges which differ from those covered by existing accessibility guidance for application development.

In this guidance we consider four common types of Data Science products:

* Data - Usually tabular data presented either as files or queried through a web service or API
* Notebooks - Computational notebooks such as Jupyter offer an interactive way to explore data and techniques and present prototypes or reproducible analyses
* Dashboards & web applications - Interfaces for production use of where interactivity is needed are often presented as web applications or dashboards. These usually combine query forms, visualisations, stats and data
* Written reports - Analysis on a particular topic is often presented as a report containing text, tables of data, and charts.
